## Introduction

Welcome. Hello everyone, I'm Ifan Hakim, I'm a simple person and have an interest in Machine Learning and also Data Analytics. Currently I still need to learn a lot and I hope I can help a lot of people :D

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques for cleaning, transforming, and normalizing data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms including regression, classification, clustering, and more.
- **Data Visualization**: Tools and methods for creating insightful visualizations.
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics and methods for evaluating model performance.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations and step-by-step tutorials.

## Installation
